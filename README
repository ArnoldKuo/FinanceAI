THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED. I AM NO LONGER WORKING ON IT.

FinanceAI is an open source project with the goal of providing
advanced Artificial Intelligence, Statistical and Mathematical tools
for amateur and sophisticated investors. The purpose was to develop a
complete algorithmic trading platform with comprehensive AI and
Quantitative Finance libraries. It would also provide high performance
algorithms. I started this project in early 2008, but so far it didn't
get past the first version, mostly because of lack of time.

The application that I released is called Predictor. Predictor is a
tool that uses financial statements, income statements, balance sheets
and cashflow statements and creates powerful pattern classifiers based
on that data. Then it uses the classifiers to predict financial
performance.
